##Trees
###Free
- An acyclic connected graph where there is a path between any pair of verticies

###Rooted
- Free tree where a single node is marked as the start

###Ordered
- A rooted tree where the subtrees are ordered recursively
- Each node can be thought of as the root of the subtree

###Binary
![All possible Binary trees from n = 1 to n = 4](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/BinaryTreesNodes_950.gif)
- Either empty, or a root `r` and a left subtree `L` and a right subtree `R` both of which are binarary trees and disjoint
- Unlike a proper tree, the relative positions of the children is significant.
- As stated above, there is a strict limit of either 0, 1 or 2 children and exactly 0 or 1 parent on any node
- Not a tree in a strict sense, because there is an implied hierarchy of subtrees

###Extended
![Binary tree vs. Extended Binary Treee](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/ExtendedBinaryTree_750.gif)
- A binary tree where each node has two children called leaves
- A binary tree in which special nodes are added wherever a null subtree was present in the original tree so that each node in the original tree will always have 2 children (excluding an empty tree)

##Converting a Ordered Forest into a Binary Tree
![Conversion of a Ordered Tree to a Binary Tree](http://i.imgur.com/9Gv0tdL.png)
- Use the root of the ordered tree as the root of the binary tree
- The leftmost node in the ordered tree becomss the left child of the parent node
- Continue finding children of the parent node insert it as the right subtree of leftmost child
- Repeat this process for all of the nodes
- Nodes that have children in the ordered tree representation will have a left child in the binary tree representation
- If a node has a right child in the binary tree representation it has siblings in the ordered tree represntation
