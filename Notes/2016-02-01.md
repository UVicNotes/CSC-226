## Probability

How many people does it take before the probability that two have the same birthday is more than 50%?

Let's assume that all birthdays are equally likely, what's the probability that $n$ people have different birthdays?

So,


$$\begin{align}
    p &= \frac{\text{favourable cases}}{\text{total number of cases}} \\\\
    &= \frac{\binom{365}{n}n!}{365^n}
\end{align}$$

we could also think of this as,


$$\begin{align}
    \frac{365}{365} \cdot \frac{364}{365} \cdot \frac{363}{365} \cdot \ldots \cdot\frac{365-n}{365}
\end{align}$$

let's rewrite this where $D$ is the days,


$$\begin{align}
    \left( 1 - \frac{0}{D}\right)\left( 1 - \frac{2}{D}\right)\ldots\left( 1 - \frac{n-1}{D}\right) = S_n
\end{align}$$

we're asking when,


$$\begin{align}
    1 - S_n \ge \frac{1}{2}
\end{align}$$

Now, when $x$ is small $1 - x \approx e^x$, so if $n$ is small compared with $D$ then,


$$\begin{align}
    \prod_{j=1}^{n-1} (1 - \frac{j}{D}) &\approx \prod_{j=1}^{n-1} e^{-\frac{j}{D}}\\\\
    &= e^{\left( -\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \frac{j}{D} \right)} \\\\
    &= e^{\left(\frac{-n\left( n-1 \right)}{2D} \right)} \\\\
    &\approx e^{\left(\frac{- n^2}{2D} \right)} \\\\
\end{align}$$

so the probability is $\frac{1}{2}$ when,


$$\begin{align}
    \frac{n^2}{2D} &= \ln \frac{1}{2} \\\\
    \frac{n^2}{2D} &= \ln 2 \\\\
    n &= \sqrt{2 \ln 2} \cdot \sqrt{D} \\\\
    &= \sqrt{\ln 4} \cdot \sqrt{D} \\\\
    &\approx 1.1774 \cdot \sqrt{D} \\\\
\end{align}$$

### Harmonic Numbers

_definition_: The __harmonic numbers__ are a series denoted,

$$\begin{align}
    H_n = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \ldots + \frac{1}{n}
\end{align}$$

The harmonic numbers arise in analyzing many algorithms.

#### Example

Consider $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$,

### Mean Time to Failure

When do you get the first heads when flipping coins?

We can draw the outcomes,

![Probability Tree](http://www.onlinemathlearning.com/image-files/cliprob29.gif)

Let $p$ be the probability of a failure (a heads) and $p_k$ be the probability of a failure on the $k$-th try. We can write $p_k$ as


$$\begin{align}
    p_k = \left( 1 - p \right)^{k-1}p
\end{align}$$
 
 which we can see,
 
$$\begin{align}
    \sum_{k \ge 1} p_k &= \sum_{k \ge 1} \left( 1 - p \right)^{k-1}p \\\\
    &= p \sum_{k \ge 0} \left( 1 - p \right)^{k} \\\\
    &= p \frac{1}{1-(1-p)} \\\\
    &= \frac{p}{p} \\\\
    &= 1 \\\\
\end{align}$$

so all our probabilities sum to one (which is good).

## Uniform Hashing

You're a coupon collector and you're trying to collect $n$ coupons. How many do I need to collect before I can expect to have them all?

Let $X$ be the number of trials.
